This guide aims to explain how to modify a save file for Lego Star Wars: The Video Game on PC and go into details about how the game stores progression. The game writes to the save file in machine language also known as binary code but the editing and reading for the save file done in this guide will be in hex code. A guide on binary and hex code will be in this document to make it easier to understand how the values in the save file work. This is not intended to cheat as itâ€™s best to have completed the game to know how these values translate in the game. The save file is stored in a folder in the root directory of the game. On PC the game can have up to 6 save files. The folder names range from lsw_0 to lsw_5. In each respective folder contains 2 files CODE.BIN and LSW.BIN. CODE.BIN contains the displayed stud value on the save file load screen which most of the time is correct. LSW.BIN is the main save file where all the save data is stored.
